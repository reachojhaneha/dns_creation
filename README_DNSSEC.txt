NAME:
    mydig_dnssec - DNS lookup utility

USAGE:
    ./mydig_dnssec <domain> [<rdtype>]

DESCRIPTION:
    mydig_dnssec is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers.  
    mydig_dnssec performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned 
    from the name server(s) that were queried. mydig_dnssec also validates the 
    integrity of the DNS response by verifying DNSSEC.

IMPLEMENTATION:
    For checking DNSSEC I am sending a query to the root with a special flag set
    that indicates that the DNSSEC protocol is being used. After each resolution, 
    I verify the integrity of the DNS response.  DNSSEC uses fundamental 
    principles from public-private key cryptography.

    To validate I Query Current Server for Delegation Signer (dns.rdatatype.DS) 
    and Next Server for Public DNSKEY (dns.rdatatype.DNSKEY). If the items 
    recieved from  next server has the flag set to 257 it means the key-signing 
    key is set.  If not then DNSSec is not configured.  Once I get the key I 
    make the Delegation Signer for current server and verify it with the next 
    server. If verification fails I output "DNSSec verification failed" and 
    return. Otherwise I validate the server for DNSSec with the help of the API 
    dns.dnssec.validate.

    mydig_dnssec will always try each of the root servers listed in 
    https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers  namely the following:
        a.root-servers.net (198.41.0.4)
        b.root-servers.net (199.9.14.201)
        c.root-servers.net (192.33.4.12)
        d.root-servers.net (199.7.91.13)
        e.root-servers.net (192.203.230.10)
        f.root-servers.net (192.5.5.241)
        g.root-servers.net (192.112.36.4)
        h.root-servers.net (198.97.190.53)
        i.root-servers.net (192.36.148.17)
        j.root-servers.net (192.58.128.30)
        k.root-servers.net (193.0.14.129)
        l.root-servers.net (199.7.83.42)
        m.root-servers.net (202.12.27.33)

SIMPLE USAGE:
    A typical invocation of mydig looks like:
        ./mydig domain rdtype
    where:
        domain - is the name of the resource record that is to be looked up.
        rdtype - indicates what type of query is required â€” A, MX and NS.
                 If no type argument is supplied, mydig_dnssec will perform a lookup for an A record.

OUTPUT:
    If DNSSEC is configured and everything is verified
        It outputs the Answer section returned as a response for a DNS query. 
        Along with this it prints extra information like Query Time, Root Server, MSG Size recv and When was the command run 
    If DNSSEC is not enabled
        It outputs "DNSSEC not supported"
    If DNSSEC is configured but the digital signature could NOT be verified
        It outputs "DNSSec verification failed. DNSSec not supported"
