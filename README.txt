    a.root-servers.net (198.41.0.4)
    b.root-servers.net (199.9.14.201)
    c.root-servers.net (192.33.4.12)
    d.root-servers.net (199.7.91.13)
    e.root-servers.net (192.203.230.10)
    f.root-servers.net (192.5.5.241)
    g.root-servers.net (192.112.36.4)

SIMPLE USAGE:
    A typical invocation of mydig looks like:
        ./mydig domain rdtype

    where:
        domain - is the name of the resource record that is to be looked up.
        rdtype - indicates what type of query is required â€” A, MX and NS. 
                 If no type argument is supplied, mydig will perform a lookup for an A record.

OUTPUT:
    It outputs the Answer section returned as a response for a DNS query. 
    Along with this it prints extra information like Query Time, Root Server, MSG Size recv and When was the command run
